    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Chicken Alfredo is a creamy, flavorful Italian dish that combines tender chicken breasts with a rich, silky Alfredo sauce. 
      This recipe uses a classic Alfredo sauce made from butter, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese, creating a luscious coating for fettuccine pasta. 
      The dish is simple yet indulgent, making it perfect for both a weeknight dinner or a special occasion. 
      The sautéed chicken adds a hearty touch to this creamy pasta, giving it a balanced texture and flavor</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>	
      <li>12 oz fettuccine pasta</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>	
      <li>>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>	
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the fettuccine according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
      <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Cook the chicken breasts for 6-7 minutes on each side or until fully cooked. Remove from the pan and let them rest for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
      <li>In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
      <li>Pour in the heavy cream and bring it to a simmer, stirring frequently. Gradually add the grated Parmesan cheese, stirring until the sauce becomes smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>Add the cooked fettuccine to the sauce and toss to coat evenly. If the sauce is too thick, add a little pasta water to thin it out.</li>
      <li>Slice the cooked chicken breasts and place them on top of the Alfredo-coated fettuccine.</li>
      <li>Garnish with fresh parsley if desired, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
