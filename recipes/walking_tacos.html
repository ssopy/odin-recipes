    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A walking taco is a fun, portable twist on the traditional taco, perfect for casual get-togethers, outdoor events, or even a quick family meal. 
      Instead of serving the taco fillings in a tortilla, everything is piled into a small bag of chips—typically Fritos or Doritos—allowing you to “walk” while eating it. 
      The bag is filled with taco-seasoned ground beef, cheese, lettuce, salsa, and any other toppings you desire. This easy-to-make recipe is not only customizable but also a crowd-pleaser.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb ground beef</li>	
      <li>1 packet taco seasoning</li>
      <li>1/4 cup water</li>	
      <li>8 small bags of Fritos or Doritos</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>	
      <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
      <li>1/2 cup diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1/4 cup salsa</li>

        <h4>Optional Ingredients</h4>
        <li>1/4 cup sliced jalapeños</li>
        <li>1/4 cup black olives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until fully browned, breaking it apart as it cooks.</li>
      <li>Drain any excess grease, then stir in the taco seasoning and water. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the beef is well-coated in the seasoning.</li>
      <li>Open each bag of Fritos or Doritos, gently crushing the chips inside to break them into smaller pieces.</li>
      <li>Spoon a generous portion of seasoned ground beef into each bag of chips.</li>
      <li>Top with shredded cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, salsa, and any other desired toppings like jalapeños or black olives.</li>
      <li>Serve with a fork, allowing everyone to enjoy their “walking taco” directly from the chip bag.</li>
    </ol>
